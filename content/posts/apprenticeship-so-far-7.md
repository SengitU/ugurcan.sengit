When I accepted the Software Crafter Apprentice position at `HolidayCheck`, I thought it would be like in university again. I thought there will be a set of tasks that I need to learn, in order to success. I was wrong in so many ways.

First of all, expecting to have a path drawn by another crafter to follow, has nothing to do with craftsmanship concept. One of the most important thing about `craftsmanship` is learning. Namely, learning how to learn, learning what to learn and finally figuring out the path to the craftsmanship -of course- with guidance.

Secondly, there is no finish line! After six months, I might become a `Software Crafter`, but the learning will live on. Learning something new, applying something new, will always carry the crafter to become a better crafter than the previous day. With this in mind, a software crafter will always be an apprentice of future her/himself.

At my previous experiences, the companies were all about rush. I got my hands-on production code usually within a week. Subconsciously I have adopted this rush and I tried to rush my learning at very first days.

Now I know what is really important, I finally found peace. I figured out that I don't want to repeat my first year ten times, but I want to improve myself each day by learning something new. When it comes to learning, rush has no place.
