At the first weeks of my apprenticeship, I planned a strategy to keep learning continuously along the program. Since that day, I tried to stick to this plan and it worked! At the end of the first month, I re-evaluated the self-assesment form, honestly, I saw the correlation between the topics I improved myself and I studied.

As the tasks got more complicated, it became harder to create efficient sub-tasks. Tasks ended up being either too complicated, or too big to complete within a day. My colleague [Wolfram](https://twitter.com/wolframkriesing) suggested me to have a new column in my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/KlLdup7o/ugurcan-sengit-apprenticeship-board) named `Experiment`. In that column, I pile the issues that needs to be investigated in order to create efficient sub-tasks. Does it ring a bell?

It did for me. It's a `Grooming Meeting`. Well, since I have to be self-organized, grooming will not be a meeting, but it will be hacking session to figure out necessary tasks.

I didn't create my plan to be strictly agile. I wanted to have weekly iterations, some columns to track my progress and little tasks to figure out my velocity, but that was all. When I had problems with my process, another agile practice was there to save me.

What is good about agile practices is, they emerge from needs of the teams all around the world. All of us are dealing with the same kind of problems on daily basis, these practices show us the way to become more efficient.
