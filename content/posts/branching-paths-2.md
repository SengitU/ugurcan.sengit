Hi all,

Today I had chance to attend my first programming Kata in HC. A `åž‹(or Kata)` defined as a Japanese word, are detailed choreographed patterns of movements practiced either solo or in pairs in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata). The word kata also finds it's place on software. A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition.  

The kata was about matrix multiplication. Even tough my collagues already completed the kata, they were talking about improvements on it. When it comes to improvement, it might never end. This is the good thing about katas, one can analyze different approaches on a simple kata in order to achieve the best performance.  

I also setup this blog today. I remembered the days I struggled with `Wix` 7 years ago. Seems like blogging technology sky-rocketed these days. I've used `Hugo` as website builder and added `Minimal` theme on top of it. It is really cool that Hugo supports beloved markdown syntax and build website in seconds. After that my collague [Daniel](https://twitter.com/ddanielbee) suggested `Netlify` as deployment platform, I checked it out and I am simply amazed. Netlify connected to my GitHub repository and set up a commit hook. With each commit on any of the branches, the commit hook triggers a set of actions, which can be configured by the user. I configured to build and publish my website after each commit. I probably have more things to discover about Netlify, but the most important thing, it's free for both public and private repositories. Normally, most of the services forces user to buy a paid account in order to operate on private repositories.  

I need to decide upon the language that I will use during my apprenticeship. I am thinking about choosing either Go or Scala. Although the learning process itself is more important than the applied language, I always struggled branching paths like this.
