How good is focusing on something? When I focus, I feel the progress. I gradually become better on the topic. More I focus, more I become aware of the pitfalls and the possibilities. On the other hand, more I focus, more I got to tunnel vision. Tunnel vision makes me blind to see opportunities and guide me through the pitfalls. How can we keep the balance?

There is also another aspect, this one is more personal one. During the apprenticeship, I need to write a blog post every day. Usually these blog posts consist of my learnings during the day. For a week now, I am trying to implement a test framework. Even though I practiced a lot last week, it becomes way harder to write an exciting blog post.
