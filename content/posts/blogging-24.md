I have been writing blog posts more than a month now. Previously I have tried to write time to time, but every time I failed to keep up. Honestly, blogging is also a part of my apprenticeship program, so I don't want to take credit for my dedication. But this time, I wrote long enough to realize the benefits.

First benefit is patience. In every blog post I wrote, I criticise myself. I criticise every word I write, even this one. I remove the whole sentence, or the paragraph, or even the post sometimes and start-over to write the best post I could possibly write. Patiently, I strive for the best.

Blogging encourages learning and provides self-awareness. While writing a blog post I realize how much (or less) I know about the topic. Most of the time, for clarifying the concepts I write, I search online and I usually learn something new about the topic.

It was harder to write at the beginning, but writing pays out quickly. You can see how better you became on blogging in just couple weeks. It is definitely not easy to find a new topic to write every day, but if you try to write every day, you start seeking topics to write on daily basis and your situational awareness increases.

Along the apprenticeship program, I have a lot to learn, hence I will have so many topics to write. By writing, I will learn everything one more time.
