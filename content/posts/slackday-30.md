Today I have attended my first-ever slackday working group in HolidayCheck. Slackday occurs every other friday and people have chance to work on a pet project or work on their ideas. Also, there is a working group to work together on Slackdays. In that working group, if you don't have any idea to work on, you can pair some project that you interest in and contribute to it. People can review your code on your pet project, and you can strive for the best.

I really liked the idea behind the Slackday. Slackday provides free space to learn anything you want while being in collaboration with your colleagues. You can work with the members from other teams and scopes to learn different techniques, different languages and different domains. You can get out of your comfort zone.
