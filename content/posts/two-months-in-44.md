It's been two months already. Normally in two months, I see myself as a warrior trying to survive from the booby traps in the mysterious jungle called code base. I try to get used to the style and jargon of the team. This struggle creates anxiety and usually the hardest month for me in any new job is the second month. That is not the case for HolidayCheck.

It might be because, I am not working with the production code yet. However, I have had the chance to work on three different projects until today. I've had freedom to discover. First, I found out what I already knew, then I created my learning path. Every task card I moved in my Trello board, every book I read, every feedback I got from my blog posts, every raise in my self assessment form made me happier and more confident. In the first two months, I completed "The Basics" of the apprenticeship.

With all confidence and awareness I have, now I know that I will be able to help the teams I am involved in. I am ready to move to the second chapter of my apprenticeship. At the end of the six months, I will be the best Ugurcan possible among the ones in alternative universes.
