My twitter timeline gone crazy this weekend with the big news about Github's acquisition by Microsoft. For the first couple tweets, I didn't believe it. Later on, it started to make sense. They are using this open source platform to move their projects forward, check out the number of projects they have on [Github](https://github.com/Microsoft?page=1).

For the last couple days, I've tried to observe as much as I can. It's finally time for me to reflect.

Let's start with the concerns;

- In 2013, when Facebook acquired Parse, I felt great because Parse was a platform which I really enjoyed. After the acquisition, I had expected them to provide a greater vision with the power of the Facebook. In 2015, we moved our little application to Parse. In 2016, Facebook announced that they will close down Parse. I don't expect Microsoft to shut down Github, but every decision they will make about the Github will be criticized by the OSS community. If the Microsoft successfuly overcome the trust issues after this high criticizm period, it would be great. If not, life always finds a way in the open source.
- Microsoft owns Linked.in, a social network specifically designed for career and business professionals to connect. Microsoft created VS Code, an highly adopted text editor by the community. Now, Microsoft bought Github. With the power of these platforms, they will be able to understand our techniques, habbits and eventually they would try to use this power to shape software community in their favor. I would laugh at this theory a year ago, then [Cambridge Analytica Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal) blew up.

On the other hand;

- Microsoft is a mature company, they are in this industury for an extremely long time now. They have learnt from the past mistakes.
- They value open source contribution. Only the VS Code's repository has more than 52k stars on Github. As I mentioned earlier, they have more than 1800 repositories on the Github. They are already using this platform and any improvement for this platform will effect them immediately. Therefore, they will be a part of the change they wish to see.
- Employees of the Microsoft tweet about the acquisition and they would like to relieve our concerns regarding to the acquisition. These people are not the ones from upper management, they are just employees like us. What did they resonates with me, it feels like a bottom up movement.
- Microsoft's powerful connection¹ with the educational institutions will be able to introduce open source community with the students earlier.

Let's hope the best for the community.
