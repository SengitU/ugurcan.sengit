Recently I read [an article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-agile-simon-powers/) about Agile by my colleague [Cosima](https://twitter.com/gazebo_c)'s suggestion. In the article I am impressed by the following image;

This image alone, shows why some of the companies failed to adopt agile. Every company almost instantly adopt `Tools & Processes`, `Practices`. Even though visualizing the work and the progress with materials is valuable, the things that we can't visualize provides more value.

Incidentally, next day I had an internal training about agile basics. The teams I worked over the years used agile methodologies, so at the start of the training I have expected to hear things I already knew. I expected teachings like how to plan sprints, how long sprints should be, retrospective meetings, so on and so forth. But, the training was completely about agile mind-set and that's all we need to learn at the beginning. The training didn't define any implementation like `Scrum` or `Kanban`, since they depends on teams' need.

We had great exercises about importance of transparency, communication and most importantly self-organization. Most important outcome for me was about self-organization. In the exercise, self-organization exponentially decreased the necessary time for the project -exercise in this case-. Most importantly, with self-organization people strived for the best, but without it they settled for what they have. Of course, self-organization culture is hard to achieve, but definitely possible with transparency, communication and safe environment.
