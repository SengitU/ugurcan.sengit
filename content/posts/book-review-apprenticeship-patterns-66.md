I've preferred to read books about software practices instead of software mind-set. I've preferred best practices and concrete techniques of the software development over the books which show the ways to self-improvement. I didn't need help to improve my self-improvement, did I?

After reading `Software Craftsmanship` and `Apprenticeship Patterns`, I faced the importance of abstract topics. Not that I was neglecting the importance of mind-set and self-improvement, but I was thinking I had the right mind-set and I had enough methods to improve myself. We are in a world that constantly changes, in such world, how can we know that our methods are up-to-date?

`Apprenticeship Patterns` suggests patterns for various types of situations one might face during their long road to mastery. These patterns are not just easy, but also fun to do. Also, they promise a lot in return. The book starts by defining apprenticeship, and offering some patterns to the newcomers.

While I was reading the `Emptying the Cup` chapter, I wished I read this book earlier. In the chapter, authors explain why do you need to unlearn that you know to be able to learn, in an old-fashioned way. Then they emphasize the importance of `Wearing the White Belt`. They suggest exposing and confronting your ignorance, and they also know you will get overwhelmed by doing so. But don't worry, answer is also in there, you need to step back, take a breath "..., then launch like a stone from a catapult".

I found answers in this book, but each time I found an answer, I found new questions and my train of thought never stopped. If I would take only one advice from the book, it would be `Read Constantly` pattern and it's sibling practice to create a `Reading List`. But no, I will of course get more ðŸ˜Š.

In the conclusion, authors criticise the concept of the mastery. They suggest that the mastery isn't just your level of success in your craft, but it's also the level of success of your apprentices in their craft. I literally never thought that way, but it's so true.

About mastery, I have a different definition. In my opinion, mastery is an Utopia that no one could ever reach, but will chase every day. It's a bar placed by us to move forward each day where there is no end of the road.
