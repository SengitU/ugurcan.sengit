`The only thing that doesn't change is change itself`. The expectations of our clients, the tools we use to fulfil these expectations, the language we use, everything, changes constantly. We must catch up with `today`, by learning and improving every day. Some of us might be lucky enough to apply the newest techniques on daily basis at work, but that is not the case for most of us. Anyway, it is not our client's responsibility to support us to adapt and shape this constant change.

Every one of us need to serve the clients with the best toolbox that exists. This is a primary objective for a professional.

There are various ways to catch up with change, but I believe one of the best is pet projects.

Pet projects is a playground. One can practice new technologies, discover new ways to approach a problem while working on this pet project. Pet projects have no time constraints, have no goal other than we define. They do not create any pressure, while providing pure form of discovery and creation.
