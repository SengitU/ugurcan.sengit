We, humankind, tend to build a comfort zone. Comfort zone increases predictability and predictability helped our ancestors to survive the ancient times. It helped to find water, food and shelter.

We are always trying to build ourselves a comfort zone and this is perfectly normal. We want to relieve stress and anxiety in our lives within this comfort zone. We want to live in peace with this predictability.

But we **don't**.

At some point, every one of us leave this safe shelter, this cocoon. It doesn't matter if we leave willingly or unwillingly. By the time we leave our comfort zone, we realize that everything has changed. We are not living in ancient times anymore and the technology is skyrocketed. At this very moment, we confront with stress and anxiety, that had grown exponentially while we were inside the cocoon.

We must destroy that cocoon. We must defeat that illusionary peace. It is nothing more than a lie.

Yes, today I worked on `Vim`. I always tought that if there was one simple thing that I am good at in the World, it is that I know how to use my text editor professionally. The part I know was just a single mode in Vim, it was just the x-axis of a x-y plane.

There are two mods in Vim which `Normal` and `Insert`. Vim starts with Normal mode which a proficient user easily uses macros to apply repetitive work and navigate over the pages. Then there is the Insert mode, provided as default in majority of the text editors.

Experimenting the Normal mode was completely new for me. I felt insecure, because I left my comfort zone. I tried to revert things with `CMD + Z` and tried to navigate with `CMD + â†‘`. After a couple hours, I became better on it and I will be better in time, but there were lessons to learn.

Today I found my weakness. My text editor -Sublime, Atom, VSCode, name one-, hiding insidiously over there for years, just to make me blind on possibilities. I don't know if I will use `Vim` as my core editor in future or not, but I will struggle with my comfort zone every day, in order not to struggle with it this much again.
