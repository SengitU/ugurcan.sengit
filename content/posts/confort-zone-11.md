A developer must have a way to verify herself, must make sure that she develops the `thing right`.

We might hack some code snippet in order to explore sometimes, but this definitely does not provide any value for product and clients, also I consider this harmful, it triggers laziness. Even when we are fiddling around the code, a goal defined by a test case will keep us on the track.

Each code snippet has a destination. By creating a test case, we define a stop between the current point and the destination. Smaller the distance between the stops, the lesser logic we inject the code. Each small step will help us write testable, quality code, while making it easier to return to the previous point if we make a mistake.

We need feedback to become better at what we do. The compiler, the test cases, the regression tests give feedback to us. The smaller the feedback loop gets, problems become easier to work on. With smaller iterations, we increase the frequency of feedback we get.

### Patience is the key.

We might see the solution for the problem from beginning, but taking small, baby steps will surely make us confident. Also, we might be wrong at the starting point. Taking TDD approach until reaching the solution, would probably take us to a better, wiser, **simpler** solution. It will make us write the exact amount of code we need to provide a functionality.

I will finish with a quote from Kent Beck, `Write tests until fear is transformed into boredom`.
