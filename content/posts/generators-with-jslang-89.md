Yesterday I spent great time with Javascript the Language Meetup group. Our topic was the generators in Javascript. In previous sessions, I had prior knowledge about the topics, but this time I've needed to learn from scratch. At the end of the meetup I had a great feeling of achievement, since I've successfully grasped the concept.

We've used [es6katas](http://es6katas.org/), to learn about the basics of the generators. It was quite helpful. Test cases was clear and steps were small enough the understand concept without getting lost. Apart from es6katas, we had a clever meetup group which asked right questions to grasp the idea and keep everyone inside the circle.
