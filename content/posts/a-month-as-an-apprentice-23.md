I have completed my very first month as an apprentice. Last month, I learnt a lot, I shared a lot, and I read a lot by the help of wise guidance of my mentors [Timo](https://twitter.com/timoreimann) and [Wolfram](https://twitter.com/wolframkriesing).

I was impatient about everything at first. I had a mountain to climb and I just wanted to start climbing right away. I thought I had enough knowledge to climb the mountain with my current knowledge and toolset. Everything began for me when I realized that I would not be able to climb any step further than the last time. That was `insane` as Einstein said `Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.`.

### Blogging

On this month, I got rid of all the prejudices I had, found out my comfort zone and got out of it. I started blogging, you cannot imagine how hard it was for me at the beginning. It was even harder for me to share that blog post on social media, because I was afraid of the reactions. Right now, I think, blogging is one of the best ways to communicate with myself. Sharing knowledge is the best way to evaluate yourself on a topic, and right now, I want to share all my blog posts to get feedback to improve myself.

### Starting Over

When I started playing World of Warcraft years ago, a friend of mine told me “I wish I’ve been in your place now, fascinating by all the new stuff”. That’s how I feel again with the programming. I started to learn a new programming language. I practiced with `vim`, `bash` and `docker`. I am fascinated every day by TDD, by the new techniques and methodologies I learn.

Most importantly, I found a hill to hike, instead of climbing Everest, because the tiny steps will keep us going. Also, no one will be able to reach to the top of the mountain, but we will chase it every day.

Big thanks to the [HolidayCheck](https://twitter.com/holidaychecklab) for the vision they have.
