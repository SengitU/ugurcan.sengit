    <br> <div class="text-justify"><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Today was my first day at the HolidayCheck. I have really liked my work station and my collagues. Besides all of that, now I am a Software Crafter Apprentice.</p>

<p>The day started with Wolfram&rsquo;s presentation about apprenticeship. By the help of this presentation I have learned the expectations and general curriculum of the program. The curriculum contains six base topics.</p>

<pre><code>- Testing
- Software Design
- Communication
- Tools
- Agile Methods
- Learning
</code></pre>

<p>I especially liked Communication and Learning topics. The communication topic expects me to give speech on company based events at start. Eventually, I will need to speak in a meetup when I feel confortable about it. Also I have learned about &lsquo;The Egoless Developer[<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/]'">https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/]'</a> concept.
Learning topic itself taught me. I have learned about incidental(which I&rsquo;ve mostly done while working) and deliberate learning. Incidental learning for me is hearing random German words and learn them occasionally, but the deliberate learning is actually taking action to learn German(like taking a course).</p>

<p>Deliberate learning especially made me think about my learning process. Most of the time at work, I incidentally learn things in order to complete a task. After completing task, I mostly don&rsquo;t think about the concept itself. The program aims to teach deliberately.</p>

<p>I also had chance to attend my first Co Co Co(Coffe, Code, Collaboration) session. The topic was comparing strict development environment to more free environment. Daniel, collague apprentice stated the pros and cons of both approaches. I loved that so many people attended to meeting and there were so many good ideas.</p>
