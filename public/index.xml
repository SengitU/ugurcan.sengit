      <description>Hi all,
Today was my first day at the HolidayCheck. I have really liked my work station and my collagues. Besides all of that, now I am a Software Crafter Apprentice.
The day started with Wolfram&amp;rsquo;s presentation about apprenticeship. By the help of this presentation I have learned the expectations and general curriculum of the program. The curriculum contains six base topics.
- Testing - Software Design - Communication - Tools - Agile Methods - Learning  I especially liked Communication and Learning topics.</description>
